HEADER
!!!!- Need to add event listener to each of the header buttons to take you to the specific section (name should take to top)
- Make effect (maybe glowing or underline to the header titles on hover (projects, about, etc))

After:
APP
- Make loading screen in case the page takes a while to load
-(CSS) Make effect (maybe glowing or underline to all the links in the page e.g. linkedin, github, live demo link, github repo link)
PROJECTS, ABOUT
- Make each of the titles (about and projects to appear from display none to blurry and finally visible when you scroll in visible range)

[PROJECTS]
- Make small effect for when mouse goes over project screenshots (anchor:hover)
